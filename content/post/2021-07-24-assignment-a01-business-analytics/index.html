<h2>Problem definition</h2>
<p>A professor of machine learning is planning to get married to his long-time girlfriend. He has never shopped for diamonds before. In the mall, he was confronted with a dizzying array of diamond characteristics, configurations, and pricing. His quick search revealed that diamonds are primarily characterized by 4C viz. Color, Cut, Carat Weight and Clarity besides Polish, Symmetry, and certification. He scrapped the web to collect information from three different wholesaler websites to build his pricing model to ensure he does not get cheated while purchasing the diamond ring. Build a Linear Regression Model to predict the price of the diamond ring of his interest.</p>

<h1>Price</h1>
<p>The distribution of price shows two different range. First range is between $100-$700 and the second one is between almost $1800-$3300. With this information, we are not able to found that why there are no price data in range $800-$1700. Median of price is $2169 and the mean is $1717. The professor’s diamond ring price is $3100 which almost near the maximum price of the price data set. It means that either the diamond ring is precious enough or the professor will get cheated. We should analyze other specification of diamond to found whether they are at the precious level or not.

<div id="colour" class="section level1">

<p>Acording to the data, Colour includes D, E, F, G, H, I, G, K, and L.
D-F: Colorless
G-I: Near Colorless
J-K: Faint Yellow
L-N: Very light yellow
O-S: Light Yellow
T-Z: Yellow</p>
<p>The mode is for I and the least frequency relates to colour L. The professor wants to buy a diamond ring with colour J , Faint Yellow, which is the second most popular ring among all. However, with this univariate analysis we cannot found the relation between the most frequent colours and the price to help the professor. we need a bivariat analysis to figure out the estimation of the price based on the colour Faint Yellow.

<p>Figure shows that the most frequent clarity is SI1 which is very very few inclusions at 10X. The professor wants to buy a ring with SI2 that has very few inclusions at 10X and is the second most frequent type of ring among all. Again, we need a bivariate analysis to see the distribution of the dimaond ring price based on different clarity features.

## Summary</p>
<p>First, we build a univariate analysis of the metric and non-metric variables independently. We found that there is a need to evaluate the effect of other variables. Then, we analyze the bivariate of price vs all of the variables. Finally, the multiple regression model was biult to found our best estimation of the diamond ring for the professor. Our estimation is $2959.7 that is a little lower than $3100. The estimation shows that the ring worth $140 lower than the suggested price.</p>
